Exploring the Data: all data lines up with a certain year of her career

Caitlin Clark college basketball full career data

season: freshman - senior year (2020-2024)

team: irrelevant

G: Games played per season

GS: irrelevant

MIN: minutes played per year

PTS: Probably focus in this -> points per season

What next?: 
- change season to freshman through senior to order data better in the shiny app
- focus on PTS, FTM vs FTA (FT%)

- Clean up app
