## Motivation 
In NCAA Women's Volleyball for Liberty League Division, there are 12 teams in New York that are a part of the division. In a play by play dataset, each play of every game from 1013 to 2022 was given with information about the scores,  a description of the plays, when and where the games were. From this dataset, I wanted to look at the effect of a timeout on the game. I looked at both howlikley a losing team was to score a point following a timeout and how likley the losing team was to win after the final timeout of the game. 


## Data
This data set has data from 6,408 rows and 17 columns. Each row represents a timeout in a volleyball game for the NCAA women's volleyball Liberty League games from 2013 until 2022.
