In volleyball, timeouts are typically called by the losing team in order to increase their chances of scoring more points in an attempt to win a set. In division three volleyball, teams can call up to three timeouts per set and there are 3 sets per game. The team who wins at least two sets of the game is the winner.  When looking at the data for the Liberty League division for women's volleyball, we can see exactly when a timeout was called. 


In this worksheet, we will analyze the effects of calling a timeout on a set. We can find the probability that calling a timeout will lead to scoring a point by looking at the outcome of each timeout. By looking only at the first or last timeout of a set, we will be able to determine how likely a losing team is to win that set after calling their first or final timeout. Understanding the effects that a timeout has on a set can inform strategic decision-making for coaches and allow them to understand how much calling a timeout might help them win their game.
