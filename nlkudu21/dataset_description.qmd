The categories above determine how this dataset is listed on the [datasets by methods](https://data.scorenetwork.org/by-statsds-topic.html) page. Consult that page for a list of statistical categories already used by other datasets.

In this first section, describe the source of the dataset and what it's about. Give any necessary background about it and the sports research question of interest. See other datasets on the website for examples.

This file is Markdown, so you *can* use formatting; [here is a guide to the basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).
