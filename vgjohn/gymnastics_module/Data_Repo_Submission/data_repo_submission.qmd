## Data

The `ncaa_gymnastics.csv` data set includes data from the womens' NCAA Gymnastics Championships from the years 2008-2024 (excluding 2020 as no championship was held due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Each row contains details from a specific university's performance at that year's tournament championship.
