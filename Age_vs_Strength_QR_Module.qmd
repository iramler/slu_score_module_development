# Age vs. Strength: Quantile‑Regression Module

## [Introduction]{.underline}

Powerlifting is a competitive strength sport where athletes test their limits in three main lifts: the squat, bench press, and deadlift. The goal is to lift as much weight as possible under strict judging standards. Each attempt is judged by a panel of three officials who issue specific commands that must be followed for the lift to count. For example, in the squat, the lifter must unrack the bar, fully lock out their knees, and wait for the "squat" command before descending. After standing back up, they must hold the position and wait for the "rack" command. A lift is successful if at least two of the three judges give a white light.

Athletes are grouped into bodyweight classes and further separated by equipment categories. These range from "raw" divisions, where lifters typically use minimal supportive gear like a belt and wrist wraps, to "equipped" divisions, where single-ply suits and knee wraps provide additional support. There are also drug-tested and non-tested divisions, allowing athletes to compete within appropriate standards based on federation policies and personal choice. Each competitor is given three attempts at each lift, and their heaviest successful lift in each category counts toward their final total. The lifter with the highest combined total in their division is typically declared the winner. Powerlifting demands not just raw strength, but also precision, focus, and adherence to the strict standards set by the sport’s governing bodies.

Learning Goal: Understand why 4th‑order polynomial quantile‑regression is the best to model how Age impacts strength performance in elite vs. non-elite lifters.

By the end, students will be able to:

-   Clean and filter a large real-world data set for analysis

-   Visualize age-based trends in powerlifting performance

-   Use quantile regression to compare elite vs. non-elite lifters

-   Evaluate model fit and discuss limitations in the data

## [Data]{.underline}

The data set for this module was extracted from [OpenPowerlifting Data Service](https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/bulk-csv-docs.html){target="_blank"}. It contains over 3.6 million observations with 43 different variables containing the classifications and totals for an individual lifter. This data set is updated almost daily, but we are using the extraction from March 28, 2025. You can check the most recent updated .csv file at [https://gitlab.com/openpowerlifting](https://gitlab.com/openpowerlifting){target="_blank"}

Students should find that there is a stronger correlation between driving and performance statistics than putting and performance statistics.
