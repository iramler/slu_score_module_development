## Motivation

The National Basketball Association (NBA) has dominated over the WNBA in 
popularity since the creation of the WNBA 50 years after that of the NBA. 
For this reason, there are way more data sets available for the NBA. Thus, there 
is a need for high quality WNBA data sets in order to run analysis on the players
and teams. This data set can be used to demonstrate the process of cleaning, 
prepping, and determining quality of data. 

## Data

This data set contains 8920 rows and 10 columns. Each row represents a single 
game played by a WNBA team in one of the 2003 to 2022 seasons.

## Questions
The goal will be to create a worksheet for the students telling them we want to 
predict whether a team makes playoffs based on their record halfway through the 
season. First, they will need to clean the data based on prompts. When looking 
at win percentage, we will ask them what they notice about total games played by 
each team. They should recognize that the total games recorded is very inconsistent 
and that some teams have more games than others. We will ask them why this is a 
problem and to explain whether or not this data set is good quality. They should 
be able to explain that the data is not good quality because the number of games 
played by each team is inconsistent. We will then ask them how they can fix this. 
They should recognize that filtering out teams with lower games played won't work 
because the teams actually did play those games and therefore this won't work. 

Questions: 
- What do you notice about the total games played by each team?
- Why is this a problem?
- Can we fix this by filtering out teams who didn't play as many games? 
Why or why not? (Hint: search online how many games these teams played in these 
seasons. Did they actually play less or is there missing data? )
- Is this data set good quality? Why or why not?
