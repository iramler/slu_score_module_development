## Motivation

The National Basketball Association (NBA) has dominated over the WNBA in
popularity since the creation of the WNBA 50 years after that of the
NBA. For this reason, the amounts of data and analysis available are way
higher for NBA statistics, such as predictions of whether a team makes
playoffs. These types of analyses are limited for the WNBA, so this data
set can be used to predict win percentages based on win percentages
halfway through the season, and to predict whether a team makes the
playoffs based on these variables.

## Data

This data set contains 226 rows and 12 columns. Each row represents a
single WNBA team in of the 2003 to 2022 seasons.

## Questions

-   Is there a statistically significant linear relationship between
    mid-season win percentage and team rank at the end of the season?

-   Plot the relationship between mid-season win percentage and win
    percentage at the end of the season. How could you plot this
    separately for each season?

-   Is there a relationship between mid-season win percentage and
    whether a team makes the playoffs?

-   Is there a relationship between rank and whether a team makes the
    playoffs? How would you plot this relationship?
