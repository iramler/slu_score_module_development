## Motivation

The National Basketball Association (NBA) has dominated over the WNBA in popularity 
since the creation of the WNBA 50 years after that of the NBA. For this reason, the 
amounts of data and analysis available are way higher for NBA statistics, such as 
predictions of whether a team makes playoffs. These types of analyses are limited 
for the WNBA, so this data set can be used to predict win percentages based on win 
percentages halfway through the season, and to predict whether a team makes the 
playoffs based on these variables. 

## Data

This data set contains 226 rows and 12 columns. Each row represents a single WNBA 
team in of the 2003 to 2022 seasons.
