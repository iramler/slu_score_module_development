Rowing Medals (Abigail)

Introduction:
- I like the detailed information on the different types of races.
- In the *learning objectives*, change "with Base R" to "with statistical software" as I think any software will do.
- In the *tech requirements*, do a similar change to "statistical software" as it isn't really R dependent.

Data:
- With the data now on the Data Repository, replace the local tennis.csv link to the Data Repo's link.

Materials:
- See comments in the word docs (solutions file)
