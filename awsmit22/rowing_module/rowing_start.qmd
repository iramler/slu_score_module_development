I am playing around with this Olympics data set I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kalilurrahman/olympic-games-eda){}. I want to look specifically at rowing and medals. The data set contains data from the 1896 Olympics to the 2022 Olympics. 

# Loading the packages and reading in the data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
rowing_df <- read_csv("/Users/abigailsmith/Desktop/stat289/awsmit22/rowing_module/athlete_events.csv")
```

# Playing with the data

This table has the total number of medals per nation in rowing with na values ommitted
```{r}
rowing_sum <- rowing_df |> filter(Sport == "Rowing", !is.na(Medal)) |> mutate(n_medal = case_when(Medal == "Gold" ~ 1, Medal == "Silver" ~ 1, Medal == "Bronze" ~ 1)) |> group_by(NOC) |> summarise(total_medal = sum(n_medal))
```

```{r}

ggplot(data = rowing_sum, aes(x = NOC, y = total_medal)) + geom_col()
```
