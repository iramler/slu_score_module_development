## Data

The data set has 954 rows with 11 variables. Each row is an MLB home plate umpire combined with a `boost_stat` ranking how they compare with the average umpire. There are 159 umpires in the dataset with 6 rows per umpire. The data is cumulative from 2008 until 2024. 

| Variable | Description |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Umpire` | The name of the umpire. |
| `Games` | The number of games the umpire has umpired since 2008. |
| `k_pct` | The strike out percentage of batters and pitchers when the umpire is umpiring. (`Career Strike Outs Called`/`Career Plate Appearances Umpired`)|
| `bb_pct` | The walk percentage of batters when the umpire is umpiring. (`Career Walks Called`/`Career Plate Appearances Umpired`)|
| `RPG`   | The career runs scored per game when the umpire is umpiring. (`Career Runs While Umpiring`/`Career Games Umpired`)|

((`Career Hits While Umpiring` + `Career Walks While Umpiring` +  `Career Hit by Pitches While Umpiring`) รท (`Career At Bats Umpired` + `Career Walks While Umpired` + `Career Hit by Pitches While Umpiring` + `Career Sacrifice Flies While Umpiring`))|

## Questions

1.    The mean number of `Victories` for womens' foil is 11.5 and the standard deviation is 3.97.       Can it be concluded that the distribution of `Victories` for womens' foil is normal?

2.    Draw a boxplot of `Victories` for womens' foil. 

3.    The least squares line for `Victories` predicted by `Ind` is Victories = 11.5 + 0.16Ind.         Interpret the slope of the line. 

4.    A fencer has an indicator score of 16, calculate their predicted `Victories`.

5.    The actual value of `Victories` for a fencer with an indicator score of 16 is 15, calculate       the residual.

6.    The model Victories = 11.5 + 0.16Ind has an r-squared value of 92%. Explain the                  significance of this value.
