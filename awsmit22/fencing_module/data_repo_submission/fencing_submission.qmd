## Motivation

[Fencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing){target="_blank"} is a semi-contact sport that is based on sword fighting and dates back to the 1600s. There are three weapon types in fencing, epee, foil, and sabre. Fencing consists of bouts in which two fencers face-off against each other on a strip (14 x 1.5 meters). During bouts fencers attempt to hit each other with their weapon within the valid target area. Target areas vary for each weapon type. For epee, the entire body is a target area, for foil only the torso is a valid target area, and for sabre the target area is from the hips to the head. Bouts last 9 minutes total and are broken into three 3-minute phrases with a minute break in between. A bout is won by the first fencer to reach 15 touches, if the bout ends before either fencer has 15 touches, the fencer with the most touches is
declared winner.

At the [collegiate level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_fencing){target="_blank"}
the fencing season comes to a close with the [NCAA Fencing Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Fencing_Championships){target="_blank"} which is hosted at a different school every year. The championship is non-divisional and consists of the top fencers from schools in each NCAA region (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic/South, Midwest, and West). Fencers qualify for nationals based on their performance at regionals. Schools are allowed up to 12 fencers total in the tournament, but are only allowed a maximum of two fencers in each weapon and gender. The final championship consists of a 24 fencer round-robin in which each fencer in the discipline faces each other in 5-touch bouts. Fencers are ranked based on descending indicator scores which is the difference in touches sent and touches received. The top 4 fencers from each discipline face each other off in a round of 15-touch semifinals and championship bouts. The fencer to win the championship places number 1 in the discipline. Each school is awarded a point for each victory from each of their fencers. Schools' points are added and ranked, and the school with the most points at the end of the tournament wins.

This [fencing dataset](fencing.csv){target="_blank"}(fencing.csv) contains the final results for each individual fencer in the 2024 NCAA Fencing Championships hosted at Ohio State University. It has data for both men and women in all three weapon types. **FINISH WHEN I'M DONE QUESTIONS**
