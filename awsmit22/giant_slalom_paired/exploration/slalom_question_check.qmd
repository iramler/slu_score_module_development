# Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

# Data

```{r}
slalom_df <- read_csv("~/Desktop/git/score_new/awsmit22/giant_slalom_paired/module/Tremblant1.csv")
```

# Question 1

Find the mean and standard deviation of the difference between Run1_Time and Run2_Time. 

```{r}
diff <- slalom_df |> mutate(time_diff = Run1_Time-Run2_Time) |> filter(!is.na(time_diff))

mean(diff$time_diff)

sd(diff$time_diff)
```

# Question 2

Find a 95% CI for difference in mean run times and give an interpretation of this interval. (If computing by hand, use n = 27 as three racers DNF Run 2).

```{r}
sqrt(27)
2.052*(0.7064455/5.196152) 
-0.9003704 + 0.2789807
-0.9003704 - 0.2789807
```

# Question 3

Perform a test for difference in means. State hypotheses, test statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and an informative conclusion.

```{r}
t.test(diff$time_diff)
```
