## Motivation

[Climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing){target="_blank"} can be a form of adventure tourism but is also a [competitive sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_climbing){target="_blank"} at the [collegiate level](https://usaclimbing.org/compete/collegiate-series/){target="_blank"}. 

In collegiate climbing, there are typically two main disciplines: lead climbing and bouldering.The main difference is that in lead climbing competitions, climbers ascend higher walls using ropes whereas bouldering competitions take place on shorter walls without ropes. In bouldering, climbers complete short, challenging "problems" (routes) that require strength, technique, and problem-solving skills. In lead climbing climbers have a set amount of time (usually 6 minutes) to complete a single, challenging route. They aim to reach as high as possible and score points based on the difficulty of holds reached. Points in lead climbing are typically awarded based on the highest point reached on the route. Bonus points might be given for reaching certain holds or making progress. For bouldering, points are awarded based on successfully completing each problem. Climbers earn points for reaching the top or completing designated holds, with fewer attempts leading to higher scores.

In collegiate climbing competitions, both lead climbing and bouldering are often included as separate disciplines. Each discipline tests different aspects of a climberâ€™s skills and strengths, providing a diverse and challenging environment for competitors.

Both the [boulder.csv](boulder.csv){target="_blank"} and [lead.csv](lead.csv){target="_blank"} datasets are taken from the [2023 collegiate national climbing championship finals](https://usac.climb8a.com/comp/2023-collegiate-nat){target="_blank"} hosted in Colorado Springs, Colorado on April 28th, 2023. The datasets contrain the results from the boulder and lead disciplines respectively for both men and women. 

## Data

### Bouldering

The data set has 480 rows with 12 variables. Each row is a `Boulder` and a `Problem`, the climber had to complete in the finals of the national climbing championship in 2023. There are 40 climbers total in the dataset with four boulders and 3 problems per boulder. So there are 12 rows per climber.
