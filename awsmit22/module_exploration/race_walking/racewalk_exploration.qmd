# Libraries and Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
worldchamps <- read_csv("~/Desktop/git/stat_289_score/awsmit22/module_exploration/race_walking/worldchamps.csv")
```

# Data Prep

```{r}
ten <- worldchamps |> filter(DISTANCE == 10000) |> separate(TIME, into = c("TIME", "RECORD"), sep = " ") |> separate(TIME, into = c("MIN", "SEC"), sep = ":") |> mutate(MIN = as.double(MIN), SEC = as.double(SEC)) |> mutate(SEC = SEC/60) |> mutate(TIME = SEC + MIN) |> mutate(RECORD = replace_na(RECORD, replace = "NONE")) 
```

```{r}
twenty <- worldchamps |> filter(DISTANCE == 20000) |> separate(TIME, into = c("TIME", "RECORD"), sep = " ") |> separate(TIME, into = c("HRS", "MIN", "SEC"), sep = ":") |> mutate(HRS = as.double(HRS), MIN = as.double(MIN), SEC = as.double(SEC)) |> mutate(HRS = HRS*60, SEC = SEC/60) |> mutate(TIME = HRS + SEC + MIN) |> mutate(RECORD = replace_na(RECORD, replace = "NONE")) 
```

```{r}
complete <- full_join(ten, twenty)
```

```{r}
racewalking <- complete |> select(POS, COUNTRY, ATHLETE, RECORD, DISTANCE, GENDER, TIME)
```

```{r}
racewalking_df <- racewalking |> mutate(SPEED= DISTANCE/TIME) 
```

Times in minutes
Distance is in meters
Gender 0 is Men
Gender 1 is women
Speed is in m/min for now but could be adjusted to m/sec if i decide thats better

# Exploration

* could do the speed and see if theres a difference for the distances *

```{r}
racewalking_df |> filter(POS == 1)
```
