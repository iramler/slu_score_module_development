## Motivation

[Indoor Rowing (Erging)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_rower){target="_blank"}
is a form of indoor exercise. Erging is primarily used by rowers to
prepare for the season while the water is frozen over. It can also be a
form of cardio exercise for non-rowers. Erging involves sitting down on
a rowing machine while pulling a handle towards the stomach. There are
several variations of the rowing machine but the most common one is
pictured below.

The below video shows the motion of erging.

[Concept2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept2){target="_blank"} is the main company that sells ergs and other rowing equipment. All Concept2 ergs are equipped with performance monitor screens which measure a rowers, speed, time, rate, and distance. Since 1999, rowers have been able to log their ergs on an [online logbook](https://log.concept2.com){target="_blank"} which until then had been physical. In 2022, Concept2 released the [ErgData App](https://www.concept2.com/ergdata){target="_blank"} which connects to performance monitors via Bluetooth, when rowers use this app the data is immediately uploaded to their logbooks but it is still possible to manually record workouts in the online logbook. In the online logbook, Concept2 includes the option for rowers to "Rank" certain common workouts to compare with other rowers globally. These rankings are available to the general public on the [Concept2 website](https://log.concept2.com/rankings){target="_blank"}. 

The [erg.csv](erg.csv){target="_blank"} dataset contains data from the 2018-2023 rankings. The dataset includes the top 50 erg times for 2k, 6k, and 10k distances for both men and women. In looking at the speeds and times for the different distances it will be interesting to identify any potential patterns amongst the groups. 

## Data

The data set has 1,800 rows with 14 variables. Each row is an erg piece completed by a rower between 2018 and 2023. There are 1,088 different rowers in the dataset, with 50 erg pieces in each category.
