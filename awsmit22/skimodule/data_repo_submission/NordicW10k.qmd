## Motivation

The International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), organizes and records a series of events such as the World Cup which exists for all disciplines of FIS such as Nordic Skiing. World Cup races occur every weekend between January and March, with events hosted in different countries. These events consist of multiple different races, held in different disciplines and distances. Nordic skiing is split up into two different techniques, classic and skate, all race weekends have a mixture of skate and classic technique races. The race in this dataset is a women’s' 10k classic race set in Trondheim, Norway. In long distance pieces like 10ks there is often a lot of discussion about pacing. Racers' times are recorded at different distance intervals throughout the course. It is interesting to look at how well racers' times at different distances predict their rank at the end of the race. I think especially the first time is most interesting to see with regard to the final rank, to see if the same racers who have top times in the first distance have good ranks at the end of the race. 

The following questions are based on a dataset from a Nordic Ski race in Trondheim, Norway on the 17th December 2023. The race is one of many World Cup events held by the International Ski Federation throughout the months of December through March. This race in particular was a 10-kilometer women’s race in the classic technique, with 61 women enrolled. The course for this race consisted of two 5-kilometer loops. In the original data set, there are 4 different distance intervals taken at 1.3, 4.3, 7.5, and 10k respectively. 


## Data

Each row of the dataset represents a skier in the womens' 10k classic
ski race in Trondheim. There are 61 racers in the dataset and 20 variables.

## Questions

1.	Find the correlation between Time1 and Rank4. Is there a strong correlation and if so, is it positive or negative?

2.	Fit a simple linear regression model of Rank4 predicted by Time1. Interpret the coefficient of Time1.

3.	Check the conditions for the model, assess its variance, linearity, and residual normality.

4.	Jessie Diggins had a time of 4.82 minutes in Time1, use the model to predict what her Rank4 will be.
