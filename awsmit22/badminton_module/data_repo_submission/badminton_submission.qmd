## Motivation

[Badminton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/badminton){target="_blank"} is
a racket sport played by pairs (`Doubles`) or individuals (`Singles`).
Badminton takes place on a court with a net in the middle separating the
opponents. Players use rackets to hit a feathered ball known as the
birdie across the net. Matches are won through the best of three games,
each match is won by the first team to get 21 points. Points are won
when the birdie hits the ground in the opposing side's court.

While often considered a recreational sport, it is also played at the
professional and
[Olympic](https://olympics.com/en/news/badminton-guide-how-to-play-rules-olympic-history){target="_blank"} level. The [BWF Badminton World Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BWF_World_Tour){target="_blank"} is
a tournament series with opens hosted in different countries around the
world. The tour has been running since 2018 and even took place in 2020
despite the covid-19 pandemic. Statistics have been compiled from each
World Tour, a notable statistic being the `Points H2H` which looks at
the points for (`pts_for`) a player and the points against (`pts_agst`) them.

The `pts_for` variable in this [badminton
dataset](badminton.csv){target="_blank"} (badminton.csv) could provide
some insight on patterns in badminton. **COME BACK TO AFTER QUESTIONS ARE DONE**
