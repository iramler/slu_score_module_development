## Motivation

Handball is a popular sport in many European countries such as Germany where it is said to have originated. The Bundesliga, for example, is a German professional handball league. Handball is typically played indoors on a rectangular court (20m x 40m). There are two goals (3m x 2m) on opposite sides of the court, the goal for each team is to score a goal by getting the ball in the other team's goal. The challenge to this is that there is a semicircle with a radius of 6m surrounding the goal which players other than the goal keeper are not allowed in, making it challenging to score. Players run back and forth down the court passing the ball to each other and trying to score. There are seven positions total in handball: the goalkeeper who defends the team's goal, left and rights backs are positioned on the left and right side of their half of the court to provide further defense, the center can move up and down the court and is usually the one trying to score, left and right wings cna also move up and down the court, serving as offense when the team pushes for attack and defense when the opposing team tries to score, lastly, the pivot is considered strictly an offensive player as they are usually position in the opposing side of the court, they often work closely with the center. 

Handball is considered a contact sport which means aggressive strategies are often used in games. This data set could provide insight on if players or teams that are more aggressive are more successful than those who are more passive. Aggressiveness can be measured in the penalty statistics as players who tend to get more penalties are usually more considered more aggressive players overall. Their success can be measured both in offensive statistics as well as the handball performance index.
