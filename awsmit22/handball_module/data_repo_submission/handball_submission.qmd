## Motivation

Handball is a popular sport in many European countries such as Germany where it is said to have originated. Handball is similar to soccer except players use their hands to move the ball instead of their feet. 

## Data

The dataset has 342 players from 18 different clubs, with 18 variables, 15 of which are statistics. Each row in the data set is a player in the Handball-Bundesliga during the 2022-23 season.
