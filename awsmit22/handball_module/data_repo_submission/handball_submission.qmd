## Motivation

Handball is a popular sport in many European countries such as Germany where it is said to have originated. Handball is typically played indoors on a rectangular court (20m x 40m). There are two goals (3m x 2m) on opposite sides of the court, the goal for each team is to score a goal by getting the ball in the other team's goal. The challenge to this is that there is a semicircle with a radius of 6m surrounding the goal which players other than the goal keeper are not allowed in, making it challenging to score.
