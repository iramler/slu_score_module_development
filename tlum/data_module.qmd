## Motivation

In 2005 the National Hockey League added shootout to regular season games. In the event that regulation time ends in a tie and no goals are scored in overtime, the game goes to a 3-player shootout. This data explores the relationship between the proportion of points won from shootout and the overall strength of the team (based on overall points).

Regulation time in an NHL game consists of three 20 minute periods. If regulation time ends and the score is tied (both teams have the same number of goals), the game goes into a 5 minute 3-on-3 overtime, where the next goal wins. If the game is still not resolved after overtime, it goes into a 3 round shootout, where players take a 1-on-1 breakaway against the goalie. A team gets 2 points for a win (whether it's regulation, overtime, or shootout), and the losing team gets 0 points for a regulation loss, or 1 point for an overtime/shootout loss.

## Data

The data set contains the final standings of the 2022-2023 NHL Season with team level statistics.

## Questions

1.  Plot `GA` versus `GF`. Describe the trend. Do teams that score more goals tend to allow more or less goals against?

2.  Create a linear model using `GF` to predict `GA` and add the regression line to your plot from part 1.

    a\. What is the standard deviation of the error term, $\hat{\sigma_\epsilon}$ ?

    b\. Is goals for a good predictor of goals against? What part of the output did you use to make this decision?

3.  Run a correlation test between `pct_so` and `ppg`.

    a\. Is there a significant relationship between the proportion of points won from shootout and the overall strength of the team (based on overall points)?

4.  Is there a relationship between the total number of goals a team scored during the season (`GF`) and the proportion of shootout points they won (`pct_so`)?
