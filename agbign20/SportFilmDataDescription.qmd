## Motivation

The dataframe, AllSportFilmsData.csv, is joined from the IMDb website of the films' average ratings and types of sport films from wikipedia. The data explores the intersection of sports and films, showcasing how sports have influenced the creation of films and how these sport films inspire people to be involved in athletic teams. Using sport films offers a unique perspective compared to games scores and statistics, telling a story of athletes in a way that numbers can't fully convey.
