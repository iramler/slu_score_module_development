SCORE at St. Lawrence: Developing Introductory Level Statistics Resources Using Non-Traditional Sports Data

The SCORE Network is a national organization that focuses on developing and distributing Sports Content for Outreach, Research, and Education (SCORE) in data science and statistics. The St. Lawrence chapter of SCORE focuses on the use of non-traditional sports data, like ESports, Motorsports, Golf, and Running to develop introductory level statistics resources to be used by educators. Modules include topics like summary statistics, hypothesis testing, linear regression, and data manipulation to fully cover a variety of courses. SCORE as a whole seeks to implement educational framework based real-world problems and applications students are likely to be interested in to engage them in the classroom. This presentation will focus on the development process and the educational framework of modules produced by our chapter of SCORE, which is offered as a semester-long independent study in Statistics. In addition, it will highlight the contributions made to the broader SCORE network, by emphasizing our innovative approach to statistics education through non-traditional sports data.
