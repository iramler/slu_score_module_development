#### About the data

A data frame for the 2024 Dakar Rally, is an annual off-road endurance event that typically spans over two weeks and covers thousands of kilometers across challenging terrain in Saudi Arabia. Participants, including motorcyclists, drivers, and truckers, compete in various categories, facing extreme conditions like deserts, mountains, and dunes, making it one of the toughest motor-sport events in the world. But in this investigation we will be looking at the motorist statistics for all 12 stages of the race. The data frame has a total of 1584 observations with 16 variables. However, the way the race is set up so after each stage, drivers can drop out or be eliminated after each stage due to various reasons such as mechanical failures, accidents, injuries, or exceeding time limits. Therefore, the race started with 142 drivers, and by the time the 12th stage came around only 103 drivers remained.

### Questions

`1.` 




Ex.....
`1.` What are the most significant predictors of a bull rider's final points?

`2.` What is the stronger model for predicting PBR's final points?

`3.` Are there any outliers or a potential influential point? How would we handle these point(s)?

`4.` If we want to improve a model with the current data, how can we fix it with a transformation?
