# Questions from Module

## 1. What are the most significant predictors of a bull rider's final points?

correlation matrix

```{r}
riders %>%
  select(-Rider) %>%
  cor() %>%
  round(2)
```


```{r}
riders %>%
  select(-Rider) %>%
  lm(Points ~ ., data = .) %>%
  summary()
```


Rides + buckoff + Outs very colineaer ------ use for question multicolinearity

1/3 will not be included in the model


## 2 What can can we do to transform the data to improve the model?

```{r}
# original Model
riders %>%
lm(Points ~  `Avg Buckoff Time` + Rides + prop.Ridden, data = .) %>%
  summary()
```


```{r}
# interaction model of original model
riders %>%
lm(Points ~  `Avg Buckoff Time` + Rides + `Avg Buckoff Time`:Rides  + prop.Ridden, data = .) %>%
  summary()
```


## loooking. ats transformation now

```{r}
riders %>%
lm(Points ~  `Avg Buckoff Time` + Rides + prop.Ridden, data = .) %>%
  summary()


print("Transformation model (Below)")

riders %>%
lm(Points ~  poly(`Avg Buckoff Time`, 2) + Rides + I(prop.Ridden^2), data = .) %>%
  summary()
```
