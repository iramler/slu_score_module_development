## Setting Up the Data

```{r}
# load in package and data downloaded from kaggle
library(tidyverse)
race_results <- read.csv("TripleCrownRaces_2005-2019.csv")
track_conditions <- read.csv("TrackConditions.csv")
```

```{r}
# join the 2 datasets
horseracing <- inner_join(race_results, track_conditions, by = c("year", "race"))
```

```{r}
# writing as csv
write.csv(horseracing, "triple-crown.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
