        "# Introduction\n",
        "The Professional Woman’s Hockey League (PWHL) began its inaugural season in 2023-24. The league has players from 11 different countries. The league looks to expand its exposure and gain new fans for the future of the sport.\\\n",
        "We will be investigating the player statistics from the league’s inaugural season. Our focus will be on all players including goalies which includes 147 athletes. We want to discover which age groups and positions have had the most impact on the number of points scored per game by each player. A player is credited with one point for either a goal or an assist. Each position has a different role in contributing to the team. In general, the main goal of the forwards is to stay in three different lanes across the ice, moving the puck between them to make the opposing goalie move and open scoring opportunities. The defensive players compliment the forwards by positioning themselves along the boundary of the offensive zone to prevent the opposing team from moving the puck away from the zone and provide more opportunities for the forwards to score. The goalie’s focus is to guard their team’s goal by positioning themselves in front of it to prevent the opposing team from scoring. The different age groups represent a blend of experience and athleticism at a point in the player’s career. More experience should help the player score more goals because they would have more knowledge of the game and ideas on how to score. However, more experience comes with more aging and players with more experience may be past their years of peak athleticism. That is why our goal is to find if there is a perfect blend between the two (i.e. an ideal age and position group), while keeping in mind that the older players may not be representative of all players who enter the league. Consider this definition of \"survivorship bias\": https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/survivorship-bias\n"
