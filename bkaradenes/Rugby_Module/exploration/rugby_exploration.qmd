# Fixing date variable

```{r}

```

```{r}
post_1899 <- rugby[117:2770, ]
```

```{r}
post_1899 <- post_1899 %>%
  mutate(date = as.numeric(date))
post_1899$date <- as.Date(post_1899$date, origin="1900-01-01")
```

```{r}
post_1899 <- post_1899 %>%
  mutate(date = as.character(date))

# Joining data back together

```{r}
rugby <- bind_rows(pre_1900, post_1899)
```

# Create winner variable

```{r}
rugby <- rugby %>%
  mutate(winner = case_when(
    home_score > away_score ~ home_team,
    away_score > home_score ~ away_team,
    TRUE ~ "Tie"
  ))

# Parsing Date Variable

```{r}
rugby <- rugby %>%
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date))
```
