## Motivation

The Negro Leagues were a group of leagues containing professional African-American baseball players from the late 19th century into the 1940s. Although the MLB didn't desegregate until the 1940s, the Negro Leagues still produce some of the game's all-time great players.

## Data

The dataset contains 502 rows and 34 columns. Each row represents a player that played in the Negro Leagues from 1896 to 1948 and their career statistics.
