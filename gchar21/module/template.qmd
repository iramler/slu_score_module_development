## Motivation

League of Legends is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game where two teams of five players compete on a map called Summoner's Rift. Each player selects a champion with unique abilities and plays a specific role on the team.

Summoner's Rift is divided into three lanes: top, middle, and bottom. The bottom lane, also known as the bot lane, is where you typically find the ADC (Attack Damage Carry) and Support champions.

The ADC's primary objective is to deal sustained damage throughout the game. They rely on items and experience to scale their damage output and become late-game threats. Conversely, the Support champions focus on providing utility, crowd control, and protection to enable the ADC to thrive. This includes abilities that heal, shield, or buff their ADC, as well as crowd control spells to disrupt enemies.

Analyzing gameplay data allows us to identify the most successful ADC and Support champion combinations based on their win rates. By assessing these statistics, we can determine the top 5 ADC and Support champions, and beyond those, other ADC and Support champions fall into the "other" category. Hence, using Chi-Squared analysis, we will evaluate if specific pairings exhibit exceptional synergy. This synergy between ADC and Support is crucial for securing objectives, winning team fights, and ultimately achieving victory on the battlefield. 

## Data

Each row in the data set represents a combination of two champions selected for two roles: ADC and Support and their respective wins and losses. 

| Variable             | Description                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|

| SUP                  | The Support champion used in the match          |
| Losses               | The number of losses in the match               |
| Wins                 | The number of wins in the match
