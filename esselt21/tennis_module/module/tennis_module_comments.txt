Eric Seltzer (Tennis)


YAML:
- Update the Date
- Description: Be sure to connect the topic to tennis

Introduction:
- Should be sure to ay what ATP is before using the abbreviation
- There isn't anything about the court surface in your introduction. Be sure to clearly discuss this as it is a focal point of the worksheets.
- Should better describe the basic idea of Elo. (It is sort of there, but isn't exactly clear that the harder vs easier thing is about Elo.)

Tech requirement:
- We'll want to provide an alternate set of handouts that allow the students to use software (like Minitab) to do these things.

Data:
- With the data now on the Data Repository, replace the local tennis.csv link to the Data Repo's link.

Materials:
- See comments in the word docs (solutions file)

Conclusions:
- Summarize the results of the analysis.
