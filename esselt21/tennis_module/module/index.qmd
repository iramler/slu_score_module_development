## Module

Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.

### Introduction

In the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) the rankings are typically based on set parameters. Throughout the year there are tournaments that are worth different numbers of points. There are four tiers of events, Grand Slams, Masters 1000, ATP 500 and ATP 250. You receive the most points in your [ATP rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_rankings) from winning a Grand Slam, and the least from winning an ATP 250 tournament. In Tennis, there are also three different types of surfaces that are played on. The options are Grass, Hard, and Clay. The surfaces are important to keep track of as the speed of tennis changes, e.g., clay generally slows the ball down whereas grass speeds it up. Certain players perform better on certain surfaces. This data set contains information for each player on each surface. Throughout the year, there are two Grand Slams on a Hard court, one on Clay, and one on Grass. In the data that we will be using, the provider has calculated an Elo ranking. This ranking takes into account what the tournaments are, as well as who each player is playing. So playing a "harder" opponent in a Grand Slam counts for more than playing an "easy" opponent. For instance, if number 9 Elo ranked Casper Ruud plays number 1 Elo ranked Jannik Sinner and wins, it will be worth more than if Ruud played number 111 Elo ranked Stan Wawrinka.

#### Additional Tennis Information


In this worksheet, we will look at the data including this Elo ranking and look at distributions, shapes, and a multiple linear regression model. There will be questions about each of these, some of them being more open ended than others.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

1.  Understand the shapes of distribution as well as terms used to describe distribution.

2.  Understand the five number summary and be able to calculate some of its numbers.

3.  Be able to interpret a side-by-side box plots.

4.  Compare differences between two populations through visualizations.

Technology requirement: The activity handout will require nothing more than the handout and a writing utensil to complete.

1.  Knowledge of distribution types and terms that come along with it/

2.  Knowledge of the five number summary and how the numbers are calculated.

3.  Knowledge of multiple linear regression, the assumptions it must meet, and how to interpret its coefficients.

### Data

There is one data set for this exercise. The data is made up of 485 rows and 5 columns and is provided by Wheelo Ratings. Each row represents a player on a particular surface of court. The three options for these surfaces are Clay, Grass, and Hard.
