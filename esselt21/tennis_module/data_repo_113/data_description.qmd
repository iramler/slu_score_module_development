## Motivation

This data set is provided by Jeff Sackman on GitHub. There is an extensive repository of all tennis data. The data here is from the 2023 season.

## Data

This data is made up of 5194 rows and 20 columns. It was cleaned into a different format to identify metrics about each individual player. Each row represents a match played on a particular surface of court. The three options for these surfaces are Clay, Grass, and Hard.
