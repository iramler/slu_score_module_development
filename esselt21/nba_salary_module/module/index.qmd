### Introduction

The National Basketball Association (NBA) was founded in 1949 originally with around 11 teams. Since that time, it has expanded to 32 teams and is one of the biggest major sports leagues in the world. It also has some of the most sports data being collected out of any sport is there are many statistics to keep track of. Some of these statistics of the modern game are things like points, assists, shooting percentages, and turnovers. This means that there is lots of data to analyze from a long time period. In this worksheet, we will primarily be focusing on the time period from 1990-2023. This is where the statistics being recorded was shown to be in final form and therefore has the most consistency.
