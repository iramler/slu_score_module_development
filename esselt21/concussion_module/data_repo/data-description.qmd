## Motivation

This data set is provided by Wheelo Ratings. They create an Elo ratings system for tennis players that takes into account who they are playing rather than just how many points a win gets like the ATP rankings do. The data here is from the past 52 weeks as of May 27, 2024 and includes many variables but for simplification, the variables have been narrowed down to 5 important indicators of a players ability to win a match.

## Data

This data is made up of 485 rows and 5 columns. Each row represents a player on a particular surface of court. The three options for these surfaces are Clay, Grass, and Hard.

| Variable                       | Description                                                       |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Player                         | The player for which the data corresponds to                      |
| Team                           | The team that the player plays for                                |
| Date                           | The date in which the concussion happened                         |
| Position                       | The position that the player plays                                |
| Games Missed                   | The number of games the player missed with the injury             |
| Reported Injury Type           | What the injury was reported as                                   |
| Play Time After Injury         | How many downs the player played after getting injured            |
| Average Playtime Before Injury | How much the player was playing on average before getting injured |

## Questions

1.  Learn how to build regression models with the data set

2.  Look at differing types of distribution across variables

3.  Create and interpret correlation matrices

4.  Create side-by-side boxplots

If possible, list some analyses or research questions that could be answered with this dataset, or the types of questions you'd ask students. This is mainly meant to give other instructors ideas for how they could use the data.
