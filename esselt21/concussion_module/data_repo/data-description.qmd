## Motivation

This data set is found on Kaggle. It has data on the number of concussions that were reported in the NFL from 2012-2014. Some of the variables it has are the player's name, their team, their position, how long the play on average, and how long they played after the injury occurred.

## Data

This data is made up of 392 rows and 10 columns. Each row represents a player that experienced a concussion during the set time frame.
